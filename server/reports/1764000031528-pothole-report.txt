**1. Issue Classification**

Hazardous Road Surface Defect (Pothole)

**2. Date Reported**

November 24, 2025

**3. Key Details**

A complaint has been filed regarding a large and expanding pothole located at **123 Main Street**. The issue is situated in an urban area, which suggests a higher volume of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.

According to the report, the pothole has been progressively worsening over the past week, indicating an ongoing and potentially accelerating degradation of the road surface.

**4. Recommended Department**

**Department of Public Works** / **Streets and Maintenance Division**

This issue falls directly under the purview of road infrastructure maintenance and repair.

**5. Suggested Priority Level**

**High / Urgent**

**Justification:** The 'High' severity classification is appropriate given the reported size of the pothole and its location in a busy urban area. The fact that it is actively "growing bigger" presents a significant and immediate risk of:
*   Damage to vehicles (tires, suspension, alignment).
*   Safety hazards for cyclists and motorcyclists.
*   Accelerated decay of the surrounding road infrastructure.

Immediate assessment and scheduling of repairs are strongly recommended to mitigate these risks and prevent further deterioration.
